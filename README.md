# slitherPlayer
a python bot to play the popular browser game Slither.io

This was an over-ambitious attempt to build a bot to beat Slither, before actually learning Python. Afternoons were spent, and valuable lessons were learned about learning to walk before you run haha.
Should likely scrap and start over now that I've learned python. Still think this is a cool project.
